(a) FUNCTION OVERLOADING – FUNCTIONOVERLOADING.CPP

AIM:

To demonstrate function overloading where multiple functions have the same name but different parameter types or numbers.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Function overloading allows defining multiple functions with the same name but differing in the number or types of parameters. The compiler determines which function to call based on arguments.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Define a class with multiple functions having the same name but different parameter types.

Create an object of the class.

Call each overloaded function with appropriate arguments.

Display the results of each function call.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully demonstrates function overloading, allowing the same function name to perform different operations based on parameters.

(b) OPERATOR OVERLOADING – OPERATOROVERLOADING.CPP

AIM:

To demonstrate operator overloading where a class defines custom behavior for operators like +.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Operator overloading allows giving special meaning to operators for user-defined data types. For example, + can be overloaded to add complex numbers.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Define a class with private data members.

Overload the + operator inside the class to perform addition of objects.

Create objects of the class.

Use the overloaded operator to combine objects.

Display the results using a class method.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully demonstrates operator overloading, allowing operators to work with user-defined types.

(c) CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING – CONSTRUCTOROVERLOADING.CPP

AIM:

To demonstrate constructor overloading where a class has multiple constructors for different initialization methods.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Constructor overloading allows defining multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists. This enables objects to be initialized in various ways.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Define a class with multiple constructors (default and parameterized).

Create objects using different constructors.

Display the values of the objects.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully demonstrates constructor overloading, allowing different ways to initialize objects in a class.
